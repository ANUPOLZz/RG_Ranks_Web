        {
            question: "Which Minecraft versions and editions are supported?",
            answer: "RG RANKS supports Minecraft Java Edition 1.16+ and Bedrock Edition (including Pocket Edition) 1.16+. The pack is optimized for both single servers and server networks across all platforms."
        },
        {
            question: "Can I customize the rank designs for my server?",
            answer: "Yes! The pack includes editable templates that you can modify to match your server's theme. Use any image editing software to customize colors, styles, and effects to create unique ranks for your server."
        },
        {
            question: "How do I install this on my multiplayer server?",
            answer: "For Java servers, upload the resource pack to your server's resourcepacks folder and add the pack URL to server.properties. For Bedrock servers, upload through your hosting panel's resource pack manager. Detailed instructions are included with the download."
        },
        {
            question: "Which rank/permission plugins are compatible?",
            answer: "RG RANKS works with all major permission plugins including LuckPerms, PermissionsEx, GroupManager, and UltraPermissions for Java servers, and standard permission systems for Bedrock servers. The textures integrate seamlessly with your existing rank setup."
        },
        {
            question: "Will this affect server performance?",
            answer: "No, RG RANKS is highly optimized and has zero impact on server performance. The pack only contains texture files that are loaded client-side, meaning your server's TPS and performance remain unaffected."
